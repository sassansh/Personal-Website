      content="Hello! My name is Sassan and I’m currently a 4th year student at the University of British Columbia pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science degree. I also have a prior Bachelor of Science from UBC in Chemistry, Biology & Environmental Sciences. My love for technology started when I first touched a computer at my dad’s office when I was 7. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve worked on several personal projects, developed a healthcare analytics platform for a start-up, and contributed to a student-led mental health web app."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
